# `:engine:proxy`

## Responsibility

Implements the high-throughput proxy transport: listeners, channels, TLS interception integration, upstream connections, and raw HTTP exchange flow.

## Owns

- Netty proxy server and channel pipeline lifecycle.
- Connection-scoped resources, enforced timeout/admission limits, bounded HTTP/1 exchange ordering, transport backpressure, and mapping at transport boundaries.
- Instance-owned extension points, a persistence-neutral streaming capture sink, and protocol transport adapters.
- Streaming requests and responses with bidirectional writability coupling, bounded capture reservations, typed cancellation, and constant-time event-loop lag metrics.

## Does not own

- Compose UI, database persistence, connectivity setup, pairing/credential validation, relay, portal delivery, feature use cases, or protocol-specific inspection policy.

## Dependency rule

Depends inward on stable contracts and injected certificate/traffic extension interfaces. It must never depend on `:ui:*`, `:products:*`, `:data:*`, or `:connectivity:*`.

## Current state

The Netty implementation is behind `ProxyRuntimePort`, defaults to loopback plus strict upstream TLS, rolls back failed starts, and awaits shutdown. Default full-message aggregation, static pipeline mutation, portal routing, the duplicate pool, and callback capture are gone. Ordinary traffic streams bidirectionally; only an enabled response breakpoint may select bounded aggregation through the injected application gate. Optional ingress attribution consumes a neutral one-shot socket identity contract.
